### Salve! Ego sum Jigarius üïä

Whether you've visited my profile at will by accident, vouchsafe my greetings.
Visit [jigarius.com](https://jigarius.com/) for more about me or to read my blog.

Feel free to explore my repositories!

#### [Toggl2Redmine](https://github.com/jigarius/toggl2redmine)

T2R is a [Redmine](https://redmine.org/) plugin that provides a GUI for
importing time logs from [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) into Redmine. As my first
full-fledged Ruby project, this project holds a special place in my heart.

#### [Clibato](https://github.com/jigarius/clibato)

Clibato is a simple backup/restore tool. I created it to backup and restore
my .dot files, and to have fun with Python üêç. Do you backup your dotfiles to
a Git Repo? Try Clibato.

#### [Rochambeau](https://github.com/jigarius/rochambeau)

Rochambeau is the CLI version of classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. I wrote this
to practice Ruby and Object-Oriented Programming. FYI, the game does include
Lizard ü¶é and Spock üññüèΩ.

#### [Mission Mars](https://github.com/jigarius/mission-mars)

I came across the Mission Mars üëæ coding challenge in early 2020. I wrote this
solution in order to POOP (Practice Object-Oriented Programming) in Ruby.

#### [SPCA Scanner](https://github.com/jigarius/spca-scanner)

Late in 2020, I was thinking about adopting a cat üêà. However, kittens get
adopted very fast from the Montreal animal shelter (SPCA). I used this problem
as an excuse to write some Object-Oriented Ruby code that scans the SPCA
website and sends you email notifications about new pets. 

#### [Fizz-Buzz](https://github.com/jigarius?tab=repositories&q=fizz-buzz)

While learning a programming language, the first app I usually write is a
fancy Fizz-Buzz that explores not only the language's syntax but also things
like its package manager and tools for linting, type-checking, and testing.

  * [Fizz-Buzz Ruby](https://github.com/jigarius/fizz-buzz-ruby)
  * [Fizz-Buzz PHP](https://github.com/jigarius/fizz-buzz-php)
  * [Fizz-Buzz Python](https://github.com/jigarius/fizz-buzz-python)
  * [Fizz-Buzz TypeScript](https://github.com/jigarius/fizz-buzz-typescript)

Some of these solutions might seem complex, but remember that the objective is
to explore the syntax and try out some fancy things.

#### [Natty](https://github.com/jigarius/natty)

In 2012, I started building this modular PHP framework to  build a
SaaS ecommerce platform (and to cope with depression). Though I stopped
working on it in 2015, I couldn't get myself to delete the code.

**PS:** I wish I knew about Git back then.

#### [GUP](https://github.com/jigarius/gup)

I wrote GUP (Go Up) to explore Bash and to simplify and speed up CLI navigation.
In simple terms, GUP is a Bash tool that lets you write `gup 3` instead of
`cd ../../..`. It can do more than that though üòâ.
